On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives.

So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.</br>During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she s chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she s kept hidden from everyone because she s been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</br>Veronica Roth is the New York Times bestselling author of Divergent, the first in a trilogy of dystopian thrillers filled with electrifying decisions, heartbreaking betrayals, stunning consequences, and unexpected romance.</br><b>Specifications</b><table class="description"><tr><td>Publisher:	Penguin Group USA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> Publish Date</td><td> 	Sep 2009</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> ISBN-13</td><td> 	9780142414934</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> ISBN-10</td><td> 	014241493X</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> Format</td><td> 	Paperback</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> Number of Pages</td><td> 	259</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> Shipping Weight (in pounds)</td><td> 	0.6</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td> Product in Inches (L x W x H)</td><td> 	5.75 x 8.5 x 0.75</td></tr></table>'
